Project 1 for CS415 Computational Biology: Sequence Analysis
## Overview
Fire and evolve cannons.
## Cannon Specification
Cannons are imaginary entities with a genome comprised of two genes: tilt and shoot. Both are a list of A and C, currently of length 90, where As increase the magnitude of that gene.
## Simulation
The simulator consists of open space and a target, and fires from a populations of cannons.
## Evolution Engine 
See research paper below ->
## Tools
Python 3.12
## Authors
